# Diffusion_Coefficients_Comparator
This project calculates and compares the main diffusivities of Ti-Al-Co ternary alloys at 1473 K using both experimental and calculated values. The comparisons are based on the research by Takahashi et al., 2009. The script reads data from an Excel file and plots the comparison graph.
