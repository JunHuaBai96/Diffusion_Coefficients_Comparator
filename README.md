# Diffusion Coefficients Comparator

## Promoting the Visualization of Calculated vs. Experimental Data

This project calculates and compares the main diffusivities of Ti-Al-Co ternary alloys at 1473 K using both experimental and calculated values. The comparisons are based on the research by Takahashi et al., 2009. The script reads data from an Excel file and plots the comparison graph.

## Project Description

This project uses MATLAB to plot a comparison between experimental and calculated main diffusivities for the Ti-Al-Co ternary system at 1473 K. The aim is to facilitate visualization and analysis of the accuracy of calculated diffusion coefficients against experimental values.

## Features

- Read experimental and calculated values from an Excel file.
- Plot a comparison graph of experimental vs. calculated values.
- Highlight deviations with dashed lines.

## Usage

1. Place the Excel file with your data in the project directory.
2. Run the MATLAB script `comparison.m`.

    ```matlab
    comparison
    ```

3. Select the Excel file (`comparisons.xlsx`) when prompted.
4. The script will read the data from 'Sheet1' and 'Sheet2' of the selected Excel file and plot the comparison graph.

## Data Format

Ensure your Excel file (`comparisons.xlsx`) has the following format:

- **Sheet1**:
  - **Column 1**: Calculated values for the main diffusivity \(\tilde{D}_{AlAl}^{Ti}\)
  - **Column 2**: Experimental values for the main diffusivity \(\tilde{D}_{AlAl}^{Ti}\)
  - **Column 3**: Logarithm (base 10) of the calculated values for \(\tilde{D}_{AlAl}^{Ti}\)
  - **Column 4**: Logarithm (base 10) of the experimental values for \(\tilde{D}_{AlAl}^{Ti}\)

- **Sheet2**:
  - **Column 1**: Calculated values for the main diffusivity \(\tilde{D}_{CoCo}^{Ti}\)
  - **Column 2**: Experimental values for the main diffusivity \(\tilde{D}_{CoCo}^{Ti}\)
  - **Column 3**: Logarithm (base 10) of the calculated values for \(\tilde{D}_{CoCo}^{Ti}\)
  - **Column 4**: Logarithm (base 10) of the experimental values for \(\tilde{D}_{CoCo}^{Ti}\)

## Example

Below is an example plot generated by the project. It shows the comparison between the experimental and calculated values of the main diffusivities for the Ti-Al-Co ternary system at 1473 K. The plot includes:

- Blue triangles representing the data for \(\tilde{D}_{AlAl}^{Ti}\).
- Red circles representing the data for \(\tilde{D}_{CoCo}^{Ti}\).
- A solid black line indicating the line of perfect agreement.
- Dashed lines indicating a ±50% error margin.

In this plot, the \(x\)-axis represents the logarithm (base 10) of the experimental interdiffusion coefficients, and the \(y\)-axis represents the logarithm (base 10) of the calculated interdiffusion coefficients. Points within the dashed lines are within a ±50% error margin, indicating good agreement between the experimental and calculated values.
