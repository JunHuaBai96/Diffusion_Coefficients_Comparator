Diffusion Coefficients Comparator
Promoting the Visualization of Calculated vs. Experimental Data
This project calculates and compares the main diffusivities of Ti-Al-Co ternary alloys at 1473 K using both experimental and calculated values. The comparisons are based on the research by Takahashi et al., 2009. The script reads data from an Excel file and plots the comparison graph.

Project Description
This project uses MATLAB to plot a comparison between experimental and calculated main diffusivities for the Ti-Al-Co ternary system at 1473 K. The aim is to facilitate visualization and analysis of the accuracy of calculated diffusion coefficients against experimental values.

Features
Read experimental and calculated values from an Excel file.
Plot a comparison graph of experimental vs. calculated values.
Highlight deviations with dashed lines.
Usage
Place the Excel file with your data in the project directory.

Run the MATLAB script comparison.m.

matlab
复制代码
comparison
Select the Excel file (comparisons.xlsx) when prompted.

The script will read the data from 'Sheet1' and 'Sheet2' of the selected Excel file and plot the comparison graph.

Example
Below is an example plot generated by the project. It shows the comparison between the experimental and calculated values of the main diffusivities for the Ti-Al-Co ternary system at 1473 K. The plot includes:

Blue triangles representing the data for

 .
A solid black line indicating the line of perfect agreement.
Dashed lines indicating a ±50% error margin.

In this plot, the 
𝑥
x-axis represents the logarithm (base 10) of the experimental interdiffusion coefficients, and the 
𝑦
y-axis represents the logarithm (base 10) of the calculated interdiffusion coefficients. Points within the dashed lines are within a ±50% error margin, indicating good agreement between the experimental and calculated values.
